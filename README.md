# Playing around with autoencoders

## TODO
* Figure out what is going on with the bad predictions? Scaling of input variables before training? Add Normalisation layer?
* Smear some of the input variables. Can the autoencoder can see the anomolous inputs?
* Add some non-Gaussian tails/smearing to the variables?
